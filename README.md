# Hello World !


I am Sruthi Sundharram, a passionate and enthusiast with research interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence and its application in Bioinformatics and Medicine.

I am pursuing Masters in Computer Science at Purdue University wherein I have taken courses like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Bioinformatics.

## Research Focus

I am currently working on three different reserach field 
- Computational Neuroscience
- Quantum Machine Learning
- Image Steganography


In the past, I worked on research project hosted by Semeval2023 called [ValueEval](https://touche.webis.de/semeval23/touche23-web/index.html) which is under review to be published.


## Recent Projects
### [Image Captioning to aid the Visually Imapired using Pretrained Transformer Model](https://github.com/SruthiSundharram/Image_Captioning_to_aid_the_Visually_impaired_using_Pretrained_Transformer_Model)
- Implemented deep learning model using pretrained models from Hugging face to generate captions for images.
- These captions are further fed as input to  Google text-to-speech API for reading aloud the captions. 
- This project can be used as an extension which is made to help visually impaired people browse the image content on the internet

#### Tech Stack:
Docker | Tensorflow | Keras | Python | Streamlit | Gradio

### [Detection of Human Values from Text](https://github.com/SruthiSundharram/ValueEval_SemEval2023Task)
- The goal of the task is given a textual argument and a human value category, classify whether or not the argument draws on that particular category.
- Implemented ensemble model to classify human values from a given text.
- This is associated with Task organised by SemEval2023 called [ValueEval](https://touche.webis.de/semeval23/touche23-web/index.html).
#### Tech Stack:
Python | Tensorflow | Keras | NLTK 

### [Identifying duplicate questions using machine learning]() 
- Implemented end-to-end machine learning model to predict if given two questions have the same semantic meaning.
- Used Quora question pair similarity dataset and embeddings from pretrained model for detecting semantic similarity. 
- The ain goal of this project is to reduce the amount of duplicate entries that are often present inForums and QnA sections of many eLearning Platforms.
-  This project was aimed at finding those duplicate questions using the recent advances in natural language processing domain like embeddings from pretrained models
#### Tech Stack:
Python | Tensorflow | Keras | Docker | Streamlit
