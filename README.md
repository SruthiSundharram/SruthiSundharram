# Hello World !


I am Sruthi Sundharram, a passionate and enthusiast with research interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence and its application in Bioinformatics and Medicine.

I am pursuing Masters in Computer Science at Purdue University wherein I have taken courses like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Bioinformatics.

## Research Focus

I am currently working on three different reserach field 
- Computational Neuroscience
- Quantum Machine Learning
- Image Steganography


In the past, I worked on research project hosted by Semeval2023 called [ValueEval](https://touche.webis.de/semeval23/touche23-web/index.html) which is under review to be published.


## Recent Projects
[Image Captioning to aid the Visually Imapired using Pretrained Transformer Model](https://github.com/SruthiSundharram/Image_Captioning_to_aid_the_Visually_impaired_using_Pretrained_Transformer_Model)
- Implemented deep learning model using pretrained models from Hugging face to generate captions for images.
- These captions are further fed as input to  Google text-to-speech API for reading aloud the captions. 
- This project can be used as an extension which is made to help visually impaired people browse the image content on the internet
